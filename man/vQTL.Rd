vQTL(
  QTN,
  base_line_trait = NULL,
  var_QTN_num = NULL,
  var_effect = NULL,
  h2 = NULL,

}
\arguments{
\item{QTN}{Object with SNPs selected to be QTNS}

\item{base_line_trait}{Genetic values from mean QTN}

\item{var_QTN_num}{The number of vQTNs that you want to select or the number of vQTNs}

\item{var_effect}{This is for assigning the largest vQTN effect size if sim_method is set to "geometric"}

\item{h2}{The heritability for each traits being simulated.
It could be either a vector with length equals to `ntraits`,
or a matrix with ncol equals to `ntraits`. If the later is used, the simulation
will loop over the number of rows and will generate a result for each row.
If a single trait is being simulated and h2 is a vector,
one simulation of each heritability value will be conducted. Either none or
all traits are expected to have `h2 = 0`.}

\item{rep}{The number of experiments (replicates of a trait with the same
genetic architecture) to be simulated.}

\item{seed}{The seed number used to generate random numbers}

\item{mean}{= mean,}

\item{output_format}{output format}

\item{fam}{= NULL,}

\item{to_r}{Option for outputting the simulated results as an R data.frame in
addition to saving it to file. If TRUE, results need to be assigned to an
R object (see vignette).}

\item{remove_add_effect}{= F}
}
