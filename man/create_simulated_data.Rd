\arguments{
\item{genotypes_object}{A HapMap format dataset from which simulated data will
be generated.}

\item{genotypes_file}{= NULL,}

\item{genotypes_path}{= NULL,}

\item{input_format}{= "hapmap",}

\item{skip}{= 0,}

\item{nrows}{= Inf,}

\item{na_string}{= "NA",}

\item{shared_name}{= NULL,}

\item{maf_cutoff}{Optional filter for minor allele frequency.}

\item{SNP_effect}{Following GAPIT implementation. Default 'Add'.}

\item{SNP_impute}{Following GAPIT implementation. Default 'Middle'.}

\item{major_allele_zero}{Following GAPIT implementation. Default FALSE.}

\item{additive_QTN_number}{Number of additive quantitative trait nucleotide
to be simulated.}

\item{epistatic_QTN_number}{Number of epistatic (additive x additive)
quantitative trait nucleotide to be simulated.}

\item{additive_effect}{Additive effect size to be simulated. Follows a
geometric series.}

\item{epistatic_effect}{Epistatic (additive x additive) effect size to be
simulated. Follows a geometric series.}

\item{big_additive_QTN_effect}{Additive effect size for one possible major
effect quantitative trait nucleotide.}

\item{model}{Genetic architecture to be simulated. Possible options are:
'pleiotropic', for traits being controled by all the same QTNs;
'partially', for traits being controled by pleiotropic and trait specific QTNs;
'LD', for traits being exclusively controled QTNs in linkage disequilibrium.}

\item{overlap}{Number of pleiotropic additive QTNs if model = 'partially'.}

\item{overlap_e}{Number of pleiotropic epistatic QTNs if model = 'partially'.}

\item{specific_QTN_number}{Number of trait specific additive QTNs if
model = 'partially'.}

\item{specific_e_QTN_number}{Number of trait specific epistatic QTNs if
model = 'partially'.}

\item{ld}{Linkage disequilibrium between selected marker two adjacent markers
to be used as QTN. Default is ld = 05.}

\item{rep}{Number of experiments to be simulated.}

\item{ntraits}{Number of traits to be simulated under pleitropic and
partially pleiotropic models. The default for linkage disequilibrium models is two.}

\item{h2}{Heritability of target trait (if multiple traits are simulated).
If a vector, the simulation will "loop" over it and generate one file for each
combination of genetic settings.}

\item{h2_MT}{Heritability of correlated traits (in case it should be different).
than target trait. It should be length ntraits-1.}

\item{set_cor}{Should correlation among traits be controled for? Default TRUE.}

\item{correlation}{Trait correlation matrix to be simulated.
To be used if set_cor = TRUE.}

\item{seed}{Value to be used by set.seed. If NULL (default),
runif(1, 0, 10e5) will be used.}

\item{home_dir}{Home directory. Default is current working directory.}

\item{output_dir}{Name to be used to create folder and save output files.}

\item{format}{Three options for saving outputs: 'multi-file'
(default for multiple traits), saves one simulation setting in a separate file;
'long', appends each experiment (rep) to the last one (by row); 'wide', saves
experiments by column (default for single trait).}

\item{out_geno}{Saves numericalized genotype either as "hapmap", "plink" or "gds",}

\item{gdsfile}{gds file (in case there is one already created) to be used
with option model = "LD". Default is NULL.}
}
\value{
Numericalized marker dataset, selected QTNs, phenotypes for 'ntraits' traits.
